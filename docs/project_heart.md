## Technical Foundations

### Core Mathematical Formulation

Our weighted ensemble approach employs a dynamic calibration algorithm:

$$S_{final} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i \cdot s_i$$

Where:
- $S_{final}$ is the final confidence score
- $s_i$ is the confidence score from model $i$
- $w_i$ is the weight assigned to model $i$

Weights are dynamically adjusted using:

$$w_i = \frac{\alpha_i \cdot A_i}{\sum_{j=1}^{n} \alpha_j \cdot A_j}$$

Where:
- $A_i$ is the historical accuracy of model $i$ on similar content
- $\alpha_i$ is an adaptive coefficient based on content characteristics

For video analysis, we employ temporal coherence verification through:

$$C_{temp} = 1 - \frac{1}{T-1}\sum_{t=1}^{T-1}|s_{t+1} - s_t|$$

Where:
- $C_{temp}$ is the temporal coherence score
- $s_t$ is the frame confidence at time $t$
- $T$ is the total number of analyzed frames
