# Deepfake Detection Platform – Current Issues & Findings (2025‑04‑21)

This document consolidates the key problems uncovered so far and provides concrete guidance on how to resolve them.  Share this file with any developer or LLM that will continue the work.

## 1. Callback / UI Issues

| Area | Problem | File / Lines | Suggested Fix |
|------|---------|--------------|---------------|
| **Audio Tab** | Callback still reads the old slider id `audio-confidence-threshold`, but the component id in *audio_tab.py* is `audio-confidence-threshold-slider`. | `app/interface/callback_manager.py` → `register_audio_callbacks.analyze_audio`  | Change the **State** id from `'audio-confidence-threshold'` to `'audio-confidence-threshold-slider'` (matching image & video). |
| **Image Tab** | “Unsupported media type: image” raised by `MediaProcessor.detect_media` even though the type is valid. Root cause: `media_type` becomes `None` when calling with wrong argument order or missing param. | Multiple (`callback_manager.py` → `analyze_image`) | Pass `media_type='image'` explicitly (already done) **AND** ensure `MediaProcessor.detectors['image']` is loaded. If `detectors` is empty, call `load_detectors()` before validation. |
| **Video Tab** | Result is hard‑coded to a demo value (78 %) – no real inference. | `register_video_callbacks.analyze_video` | Invoke `MediaProcessor.detect_media` exactly like audio/image callbacks once the processor supports video. Remove placeholder HTML. |
| **Slider Range Conversions** | All callbacks manually divide by 100 (`confidence_threshold / 100`). Some sliders already output 0–1 floats; duplicating the division gives 0–0.01 results. | `callback_manager.py` (all media analyze fns) | Unify: set slider `min=0`, `max=1`, `step=0.01` so no conversion is required, **or** keep 0–100 UI and always divide by 100 exactly once. |

## 2. Processor / Backend Issues

| Issue | Details | Suggested Fix |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| **Detector Dict Empty** | If initial `load_detectors()` fails (e.g. missing checkpoints), later calls to `detect_media` raise *Unsupported media type* because `self.detectors` is still `{}` even though `media_type` is valid. | In `detect_media`, _before_ `if media_type not in self.detectors`, call `self.load_detectors()` **if** `not self.detectors`. |
| **Dynamic Model Loading** | UI lets user pick model names, but `MediaProcessor` detectors are instantiated once with fixed model names. | When `model_params['model_name']` is provided, call `detector.load_model(new_name)` or recreate the detector; ensure the underlying detector classes expose such API. |
| **Confidence Threshold Propagation** | Audio & image detectors support `confidence_threshold`, but `MediaProcessor.detect_media` only updates the attribute – subclasses must actually use it inside `detect()` routines. | Audit all detector subclasses (`vit_detector.py`, `wav2vec_detector.py`, `genconvit.py`, etc.) and replace hard‑coded thresholds with the instance attribute. |
| **Video Detector Placeholder** | `GenConViTVideoDetector.detect()` is likely stubbed; implement real frame & temporal analysis pipeline or at minimum return meaningful random/confidence values for testing. |

## 3. Miscellaneous Problems

1. **Hard‑coded demo reports** inside `register_reports_callbacks` – move to database or runtime‑generated reports.
2. **Error Handling** – Wrap `detect_media` calls in try/except and surface readable errors back to UI (already partially done).
3. **Testing** – The audit & video test scripts in `tests/` run but do not integrate with CI; wire them into `pytest`.

## 4. Quick Fix Checklist

- [ ] Update all mismatched component IDs in callbacks.
- [ ] Ensure `MediaProcessor.load_detectors()` is invoked (lazy load ok).
- [ ] Remove hard‑coded video result placeholder and call backend.
- [ ] Normalize confidence threshold handling across UI & backend.
- [ ] Expose dynamic model & threshold setters in detector subclasses.
- [ ] Verify detector subclasses utilise `self.confidence_threshold`.

## 5. Longer‑Term Enhancements

- Implement caching strategy keyed by **file hash + model params** (already scaffolded) but add size‑bounded LRU eviction.
- Support batch processing & background workers to avoid blocking the Dash callback thread.
- Replace local temp files with in‑memory buffers using `BytesIO` where feasible to reduce disk I/O.
- Add GPU/CPU toggle in settings and propagate to detector initialisation.
