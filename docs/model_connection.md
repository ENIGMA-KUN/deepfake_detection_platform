# Deepfake Detection Platform - Model Connection Checklist

## Overview
This document tracks the status of connecting real model implementations from test code to the main application.

## Progress Summary
- Connected image detection models to the UI 
- Implemented model selection dropdown functionality 
- Added analysis mode (standard, deep, singularity) support 
- Connected detailed analysis panel to real model results 
- Audio model connections (pending) 
- Video model connections (pending)

## Implementation Details

### Image Tab (Completed )
1.  Connected all four image detection models (ViT, BEIT, DeiT, Swin) to replace mock data
2.  Implemented proper model selection from dropdown
3.  Connected the ensemble detector with accurate weights
4.  Added Visual Sentinel mode for enhanced analysis
5.  Updated visualization to use real model outputs (heatmaps, face detection)

### Analysis Panel Integration (Completed )
1.  Replaced mock data in detailed analysis panel with actual model results
2.  Connected metrics (confidence, detection time) to real model output
3.  Connected model contribution visualization with real ensemble weights

### Next Steps
1. Apply similar pattern to connect audio detection models
2. Apply similar pattern to connect video detection models 
3. Add performance metrics across media types
4. Improve manipulation type detection based on model outputs

### Implementation Notes
- The MediaProcessor has been updated to support multiple models for each media type
- Added support for enabling Singularity Mode through model parameters
- Updated the UI to show real model contributions and weights
- Ensemble detector now properly weights and combines individual model results
