# Deepfake Detection Platform - Remaining Fixes Checklist

This document tracks the remaining issues and fixes needed for the deepfake detection platform.

## Fixed Issues

- [x] **Hardcoded Authentication Result**
  - [x] Ensured real model detection is used
  - [x] Fixed data flow from detector to UI

- [x] **Incorrect Analysis Metrics**
  - [x] Fixed model consensus calculation
  - [x] Ensured individual model contributions are properly processed
  - [x] Updated the detection time to use actual processing time
  - [x] Verified manipulation type detection logic

- [x] **Model Selection Issues**
  - [x] Ensured model_name parameter is properly passed to processor
  - [x] Fixed model selection in `detect_media` method
  - [x] Verified the model parameter is correctly passed from UI to backend
  - [x] Ensured model_params are properly applied to the selected detector

- [x] **UI/Data Connection Issues**
  - [x] Ensured image data is properly passed between components
  - [x] Fixed the detailed analysis panel data connection
  - [x] Verified heatmap visualization uses actual model output
  - [x] Ensured dropdown selections correctly change the detection behavior

- [x] **Visualization Issues**:
  - [x] Implemented heatmap visualization for deepfake detection results
  - [x] Added attention map calculation and combination for ensemble results
  - [x] Made heatmap visualization respect user opacity settings
  - [x] Added fallback visualization when attention maps are not available

## Remaining Issues

- [ ] **Audio and Video Tab Issues**:
  - [ ] Ensure audio tab properly uses real detection results instead of mock data
  - [ ] Ensure video tab properly uses real detection results instead of mock data
  - [ ] Fix model selection for audio and video tabs

- [ ] **Performance Optimization**:
  - [ ] Improve caching for better performance with repeated media files
  - [ ] Optimize image processing for faster analysis

- [ ] **Additional Features**:
  - [ ] Implement batch processing for multiple files
  - [ ] Add export functionality for detailed reports

## Testing Plan

1. **Image Detection Testing**:
   - Verify authentic images are correctly identified
   - Verify deepfake images are correctly identified
   - Test with different threshold values
   - Test each individual model and ensemble mode
   - Verify heatmap visualization works with different models

2. **UI Testing**:
   - Verify all UI controls work as expected
   - Test model selection dropdown in different analysis modes
   - Verify detailed analysis panel displays correct data
   - Test with different screen sizes for responsive design
   - Test heatmap opacity controls work correctly

3. **Error Handling Testing**:
   - Test with corrupted image files
   - Test with unsupported file formats
   - Verify appropriate error messages are displayed

## Notes

- When testing with Visual Sentinel mode, ensure it always uses the ensemble model
- Confidence thresholds should be displayed as percentages in the UI but used as decimal values (0-1) in the backend
- Heatmap visualization works best with Singularity Mode enabled, as it provides enhanced attention maps
