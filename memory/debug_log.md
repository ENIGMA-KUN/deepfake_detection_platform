# Debugging Log

## Error Analysis
- Main Error: `'ImageEnsembleDetector' object has no attribute 'detect'`
- Location: `processor.py`, line 218, in `detect_media`
- Root cause: The `ImageEnsembleDetector` class has a `predict` method but no `detect` method
- UI is trying to call `detector.detect(media_path)` but that method doesn't exist for ensemble detectors

## Method Inconsistency Issue
There's an inconsistency in method naming between different detector implementations:
- Single model detectors (ViT, BEIT, etc.) have a `detect` method
- Ensemble detectors have a `predict` method instead

## Fixes Applied

1. **ImageEnsembleDetector**: Added `detect` method that calls the existing `predict` method
   - Takes a file path, loads the image, and passes to the predict method
   - Added error handling to return a fallback result on failure
   - Added in `detectors/ensemble_detector.py`

2. **AudioEnsembleDetector**: Added similar `detect` method for consistency
   - Wraps the existing `predict` method with error handling
   - Added in `detectors/ensemble_detector.py`

3. **VideoEnsembleDetector**: Added similar `detect` method for consistency
   - Wraps the existing `predict` method with error handling
   - Added in `detectors/ensemble_detector.py`

## Root Cause Analysis

The error occurred because the codebase has inconsistent method naming:

1. The `MediaProcessor` in `app/core/processor.py` expects all detectors to have a `detect` method:
   ```python
   # Line 218 in processor.py
   result = detector.detect(media_path)
   ```

2. However, the ensemble detector classes only implemented a `predict` method:
   ```python
   # In ensemble_detector.py
   def predict(self, image):
       # implementation...
   ```

3. This architecture mismatch caused the error when trying to use ensemble detection

## Future Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. Define clear interface requirements for all detectors
2. Use abstract base classes to enforce method consistency
3. Add documentation about required methods for detector implementations

## Remaining Tasks

1. Test the fixes to ensure all three media types work correctly
2. Verify that model selection works for all detector types
3. Update detector documentation to clarify the expected interface
