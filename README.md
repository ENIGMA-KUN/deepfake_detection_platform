## Mathematical Foundations

### Ensemble Weighting Formula

The platform uses a sophisticated weighted ensemble approach to combine model predictions:

```
S_final = Σ(w_i × s_i)
```

Where:
- S_final is the final confidence score
- s_i is the confidence score from model i
- w_i is the weight assigned to model i

Weights are dynamically adjusted using:

```
w_i = (α_i × A_i) / Σ(α_j × A_j)
```

Where:
- A_i is the historical accuracy of model i on similar content
- α_i is an adaptive coefficient based on content characteristics

### Temporal Coherence Verification

For video analysis, temporal coherence is verified through:

```
C_temp = 1 - (1/(T-1)) × Σ|s_{t+1} - s_t|
```

Where:
- C_temp is the temporal coherence score
- s_t is the frame confidence at time t
- T is the total number of analyzed frames

### False Acceptance Rate (FAR) and False Rejection Rate (FRR)

The platform's performance is evaluated using:

```
FAR = FP / (FP + TN)
FRR = FN / (FN + TP)
```

Where:
- FP = False Positives (authentic media classified as deepfake)
- TN = True Negatives (authentic media classified as authentic)
- FN = False Negatives (deepfake media classified as authentic)
- TP = True Positives (deepfake media classified as deepfake)
